                        <p>Whether it's your phone connecting to social media or your smart home devices talking to each other, they all follow the same basic principles.

                        <p>Ready to peek behind the curtain? Let's start our journey by breaking down how all these devices communicate, step by step. I promise, by the end, you'll see networks in a whole new light!</p>

                        <p>Let's explore these layers—and you can click on each one to learn more!</p>

                                <p>Think of this as the post office sorting room. It breaks your data into manageable packets, adds tracking numbers, and ensures everything arrives correctly. TCP makes sure everything's delivered reliably, while UDP prioritizes speed over guarantees—perfect for video calls where an occasional glitch is better than delay.</p>

                                <p>If the Transport layer is the post office, this is the national highway system.

                                <p>This is where the rubber meets the road—literally the physical connection to the network. Ethernet cables, WiFi signals, and network cards operate here. It's like the actual delivery trucks and local roads of our postal analogy.</p>

                            <p>Ever noticed "http://" or "https://" at the beginning of website addresses? These protocols define how web browsers and servers exchange information.

                            <p>Think of TCP as certified mail with tracking and confirmation—it's slower but guarantees delivery. UDP is more like regular mail—faster but with no guarantees. Streaming video often uses UDP because a dropped frame is better than the video freezing while waiting for resends.</p>

                        <p>Remember when 3G let us browse the web on phones, and 4G made video calls possible? 5G is an even bigger leap—it's not just faster; it's a complete reimagining of what mobile networks can do.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What Makes 5G Special?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cloud-Native Architecture</strong>: 5G networks run like modern cloud applications—flexible, scalable, and easier to update</li>
                            <li><strong>Network Slicing</strong>: Imagine dividing one physical highway into separate lanes for ambulances, regular cars, and slow-moving trucks—that's network slicing!</li>
                            <li><strong>Service-Based Architecture</strong>: Components can be mixed and matched like building blocks, making innovation faster</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Three Flavors of 5G</h3>
                        <p>Click the buttons to explore the different "slices" of 5G, each designed for specific needs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>eMBB</strong>: Enhanced Mobile Broadband for lightning-fast downloads and streaming</li>
                            <li><strong>URLLC</strong>: Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications where split-second timing matters (think remote surgery or self-driving cars)</li>
                            <li><strong>mMTC</strong>: Massive Machine Type Communications for connecting billions of IoT devices with minimal power</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Isn't that fascinating? With 5G, the same physical infrastructure can simultaneously support your Netflix binge, a remote robotic surgery, and thousands of smart city sensors—all with different requirements, all running perfectly.</p>
                        
                        <p>This revolution in network flexibility opens doors to applications we're just beginning to imagine. What would you build with this technology?</p>
